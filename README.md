# EmoSense: Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition System
Welcome to EmoSense, your gateway to the fascinating world of real-time facial emotion recognition! ðŸŽ­ðŸ“¸

Project Highlights
ðŸ¤– Leveraged Fuzzy Logic: We've harnessed the power of Python and employed expert fuzzy logic techniques to create a robust system that accurately identifies and classifies facial expressions in real-time.

ðŸ“· Empowered by OpenCV: Our skilled implementation of OpenCV allows us to seamlessly capture, process, and analyze facial features, thereby contributing significantly to the precision of our system.

ðŸ’¡ Deep Emotional Understanding: Through our project, we've showcased a profound grasp of emotional cues and their representation, leading to exceptional recognition results that are sure to impress.

Project Files
DIP_FINAL.ipynb: The heart of our project! This main file opens up live video and, with the assistance of our meticulously trained model, predicts emotions with impressive accuracy.

Emotion_Detection.ipynb: Dive into the nitty-gritty! This notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of emotions and details the operations performed using OpenCV.

best_model.h5: The crown jewel! This trained model is the culmination of our efforts, capable of accurately recognizing emotions from facial expressions.

train.zip: Our training set - a treasure trove of data that empowered our model to achieve exceptional performance.

videotester.py: A little extra magic! This Python script brings our project to life, enabling the testing of emotions through video input.

Let's Connect!
